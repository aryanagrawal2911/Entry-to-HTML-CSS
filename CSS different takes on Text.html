	The word geek is a slang term originally used to describe eccentric or 
	non-mainstream people; in current use, the word typically connotes an 
	expert or enthusiast obsessed with a hobby or intellectual pursuit.
	In the past, it had a generally pejorative meaning of a "peculiar person,
	especially one who is perceived to be overly intellectual, unfashionable,
	boring, or socially awkward".
